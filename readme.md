## Technologies Used

## BDD

> About the pizza shop
> Order Page where the user selects: 
    * pizza size
    * toppings
    * crust 
    * flavour
    * number of pizzas
> The user clicks order and a price will be generated, in which they will be prompted to input contact details and location. In which the pizza will be delivered to them later on.

* A delivery price has not been incorporated.
